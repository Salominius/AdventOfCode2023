# AdventOfCode2023
My approach on Advent Of Code this year using C++17

## Structure
* ``helpers`` contains any functions that I think might be usefull more than once.
I will probably add more generic functions there, as the days get more difficult.
* ``inputs`` contains all inputs in numbered files (``input#.txt``).
* ``days`` contains my solutions

## Run
The code can be cloned to any folder and be run immediately without any parameters. Each day will print the results to the console.
